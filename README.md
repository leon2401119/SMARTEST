# SMARTEST  
This is an attempt to reproduce results published by Jiang et al. in SMARTEST: A Surrogate-Assisted Memetic Algorithm for Code Size Reduction  
Full paper can be found on : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9430597  
Upon reproducing the results, we plan to do some investigation and conduct several experiments on it, in hopes of further polishing the proposed method.  
I do not own anything other than the python scripts listed in here.  
Best of luck to me, and wishing myself a smoother road to graduation XD
